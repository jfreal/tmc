# Terraforming Mars Cards

Website: [terraformingmars.cards](terraformingmars.cards)

This project was started after heading to an Angular Mix in September 2018 in order to solidify what I learned and get some angular experience from a real application.

Terraforming Mars by FryxGamesis a amazing board game that revolves around playing cards.  

My game group has played this game over fifty times by now and we love it.

After I found a handy spreadsheet of all the card types I decided to try and make a simple UI to search and filter the list of available cards.
