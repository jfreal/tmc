# Terraforming Mars Cards

Website: [terraformingmars.cards](terraformingmars.cards)

### The Board Game

Terraforming Mars by FryxGames is a amazing board game that is highly dependant on utilizing different cards in the game.

My game group has played this game over fifty times by now and we love it.

Since there are over 250 cards it is really tough to know or learn them all so it is useful to have a repository you can browse.

### Inspiration

After I found a handy spreadsheet of all the card types I decided to try and make a simple UI to search and filter the list of available cards.

This project was started after heading to an Angular Mix in September 2018 in order to solidify what I learned and get some angular experience from a real application.

My goals were to:

 - [x] Use the Angular CLI and Angular Console to develop a full application.
 - [x] Created nested UI components which mimic real life examples.
 - [x] Get more familiar with TypeScript.  

 I accomplished all of my goals so I'm happy.  I didn't use as many Typescript static typing features as I could have liked but still enjoyed the language.

## Technical Notes

 - The initial version of the project was deployed via a docker container to windows Azure.  Currently it is hosted on Netlify for free.   
 
 - Mars parralax background was inspired and improved on from https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/EGqjo.

 - This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Data Source

The data comes from a [excel file on board game geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/157042/terraforming-mars-cards-list)  created by [CH0AM](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/CH0AM).  This project would not be possible without the efforts of CH0AM and the BGG community.

The file and card data was used with permission by FryxGames.  

## Future

I don't have a lot of time to work on this project so I don't know what feature I'll be adding.  If you find any bugs please let me know.

If I had to guess at some new features I'd like to try I'd:

 - [] Add some commentary on each card and how I think it should be played to help inspired discussion.
 - [] Allow more searching and filtering on things like cost or points.
