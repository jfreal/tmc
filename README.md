# TerraformingMars.cards

This project was started after heading to an Angular Mix in September 2018 in order to solidify what I learned and get some angular experience from a real application.

Terraforming Mars is a amazing board game that revolves around playing cards.  After I found a handy spreadsheet of all the card types I decided to try and make a simple UI to search and filter the list of available cards.

The initial version of the project was deployed via a docker container to windows Azure.  Currently it is hosted on Netlify for free.  Netlify handles all the continuous deployment and build processes really well.  

Mars parralax background was inspired and improved on from https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/EGqjo.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Data Source

The data comes from a [excel file on board game geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/157042/terraforming-mars-cards-list)  created by [CH0AM](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/CH0AM).  This project would not be possible without the efforts of CH0AM and the BGG community.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
